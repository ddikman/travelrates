  "about_description": "I first wrote and released TravelRates in 2019 in Bali whilst being sick with a cold when backpacking south east Asia.\n\nIt was built with backpackers in mind, where you have to compare against multiple currencies and speed, ease and offline use are more important than being exactly right.\n\nLet me know if you enjoy the app, every review motivates me to keep it running (and free)!",
