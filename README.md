## Description

### Short one

### Long one
Martin is a clever backpacker. He doesn't spend more than he has to. He asks people around him what they pay and keeps track of many currencies at once. Martin uses TravelRates for this because keeping track of the difference between dollars, rupies, euros and ringgits is much better left to a phone, it's with him even to the toilet anyway. 

As a backpacker, Martin is often off the grid, offline on a mountain somwhere. No problem. TravelRates updates the currency rates whenever there's wifi but if not, well, the rates from a few days back is good enough.

TravelRates shows him several currencies at the same time, because prices, especially when travelling is sometimes in local currency, sometimes in dollars and he always wants to know what it would cost him 'back home'.

TravelRates helps Martin by skipping those pesky decimals and gives him a clear, easy overview of what's what. Are you like Martin? Maybe TravelRates is for you?
